# Personal Phonebook and Notes Application - Chat Bot

This is a simple phonebook application that allows you to manage your contacts, notes, and search for information.

## About

This application is designed to help you keep track of your contacts and their information, including phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, and birthdays and search for information by name, phone number, email address, address, birthday. It also allows you to add notes, edit notes and search in the notes.

## How to Use

The application is available for Windows and Mac/Linux.
Download the source code from the project's GitHub repository. Extract the source code and open a terminal window in the extracted directory. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

### Windows
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Mac/Linux
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then, run the following command to start the application:

### Windows
`python main.py`

### Mac/Linux
`python3 main.py`

### Test data
If you want to create some test data in the phone book, you can uncomment the line `#print(add_test_data(phone_book_bd))` in the `main.py` file before running it. This will add some sample users with phone numbers and birthdays to the phone book. You can comment it again if you want to start with an empty phone book.

## Data storage

The chat bot uses `phone_book.bin` and `notes_book.bin` to save the contacts and notes. It reads and loads the data from these files when it starts. It also writes the data to these files after exit. It uses binary files because they are faster and more efficient than text files.
